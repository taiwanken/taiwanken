Beside him stands the youg charioteer (long chiton, skin, belt), holding reins and goad. Beside the chariot an old man (long chiton, himation) and a warrior; at the horses' haeds a waoman (Ionic chiton, himation). For the subject see Wrede, AM.41, pp. 222ff.: our vase is no. 32 in his list on p. 226.

Red line on foot and reserved around edge and on underside of foot. Dipinto inscription. A. The black-figure decoration consists of a military scene.  A warrior takes his leave. From the left, a young charioteer with a red fringe and dressed in an added white chiton with a belted white spotted nebris over top, stands to right in the red chariot box and holds his reins and goad.  Standing next to him in the chariot box, a red bearded hoplite. He wears a red crested helmet, a cuirass, chitoniskos and greaves.  He holds his spears in his left hand and his red shield, hanging from his left arm, is seen from the inside. It has a red edge and white porpax, antilabe and carrying cord. Standing on the ground before him, an elderly balding male figure. His hair and beard are white. He is barefoot and his himation is decorated with white dotted rosettes. He holds his walking stick in his left hand. Perhaps he watches the hoplite before him walk away. The hoplite has a red dotted crested helmet, he wears a chitoniskos with a red hem, greaves over his shins and shoes. He turns his head back towards the elderly figure. He carries a round white shield and spear. Of the four harnessed horses, two have a red tail and at least three have a red mane. The pole horse has a red bridle and the horse next to it has a red and white dotted bridle. At the far right, a female figure with white flesh and wearing a simple patterned chiton with a himation with a red hem over top stands to left. She wears a red taenia in her hair. The two concentric red lines below serve as the ground line. B. A Dionysiac scene. From the left, a naked ithyphallic satyr with red hair and beard dances to right. Before him, Dionysos has a red beard and is dressed in a white chiton with a patterned himation with a red hem over top and a red wreath on his head. He stands to right and holds a drinking horn in his raised left hand. Ariadne stands facing him. She has white flesh with a red taenia in her hair. She wears a simple chiton with a red-hemmed himation over top. At the far right, another similar satyr dances to right and looks back. The vase is reassembled from several sherds. Parts of the figured decoration are modern. Date: 20.03.2019 research results note: For parallels regarding the composition on Side A, see the amphora in Toledo (Museum of Art; 1972.54) and another in Paris (Musée du Louvre; F215), both of which are attributed to the Rycroft Painter. Date: 20.03.2019 exhibition text: 1    Dionysus and Ariadne About 530–520 BCE, ceramic Ashmolean Museum Date: 17.01.2023 website description: The meeting between the wine-god Dionysus and Ariadne on this black-figure amphora perhaps depicts a happier moment in Ariadne’s troubled story. She is the unsung heroine of the Theseus and Minotaur myth, as she gave Theseus a ball of thread to help him retrace his steps and escape the famous Labyrinth. But Theseus later abandons her on the island of Naxos. Her fortunes change when Dionysus finds and falls in love with her. Originating in the Greek city of Corinth during the 7th century BC, the black-figure technique of vase-painting, where the figures are silhouetted in black paint with incised details against an unpainted clay background, was adopted and refined by Athenian craftsmen in the following century.
